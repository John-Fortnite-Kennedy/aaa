                            <p>In most study domains, developing theories is a significant objective, and the importance of theory in a research undertaking cannot be emphasized. The purpose of this paper is to synthesize a multidisciplinary study of theory creation into a framework that will aid in the development and assessment of theory in project management research. Prescriptive, descriptive, predictive, and practical theories are among the four types of theory provided. To show how the framework may be used retroactively, four "classic" articles have been chosen. The research concludes with a more in-depth consideration of the ongoing debate in the project management discipline about how to improve theory.</p>

                          <p>The purpose of this research is to acquire a better knowledge of information systems (IS) project management by looking at the ISO 21500:2012/PMBoK 5 procedures that project managers utilize in these projects. According to replies to a worldwide web-based survey, processes from knowledge areas such as scope management, cost management, and time management are extensively used. Processes from key areas like quality control and risk management, on the other hand, are being moved to a secondary level, which is concerning. These findings might be essential in supporting researchers and practitioners in improving project management performance, given the poor track record of IS initiatives in terms of success.</p>

                          <p>This article will show you how to make an excellent survey that will answer all of your research questions and give data that is easy to evaluate. There are a few things that should be mentioned right away, such as Define the survey's objective. Make each and every inquiry matter. Keep things brief and basic, and you'll be OK. Ask straightforward questions, one at a time, one at a time, one at a time, one at a time, one at Questions that are leading or prejudiced should be avoided. Speak the language of your respondent. When possible, use response scales. For answers, avoid utilizing grids or matrices. If at all feasible, repeat the yes/no questions. Let's get started with the basics. Use imbalanced scales with caution, and think about including incentives. Take a test drive with your survey.</p>

                          <p>Sustainability is one of the most serious challenges of our day. The notion of sustainability has been linked to project management, and it plays a significant role in achieving more sustainable business practices. However, it will be interesting to watch how project managers think about sustainability in their daily operations. This study use the Q-methodology to investigate how project managers consider sustainability while making choices. The study question was: How do project managers incorporate sustainability features in their decision-making processes in relation to the triple constraint of time, money, and quality?</p>

                          <p>Agility is a fashionable concept these days, although it's most usually seen in literature related to software development. Agile software development is based on a step-by-step process that is repeated over and over again. Adaptability, change acceptance, continuous improvement, and strong interaction are all highlighted. The fact that there are currently few empirically grounded studies inspired this research since there is a growing recognition that agile has something to offer to the greater project landscape. Based on the preceding, the goal of this research is to give academics and practitioners a complete assessment of the methods for adopting agile in traditional project management contexts that have been suggested in the literature.</p>

Agile is most commonly associated with software development, but it has also been successfully used to hardware projects. Three of the most common Agile components are Scrum, Scrumban, and eXtreme Programming (XP).</p>

Participants in these seminars are encouraged to share their experiences in a variety of areas related to business administration. As a consequence, top executives in key positions in their companies participate in such programs in order to meet the program's primary objectives. As a result, the various business disciplines are assessed for these sorts of projects not from a formative but from an updating standpoint.</p>
